  "summary": "Completed comprehensive testing of Faster ARRIS Processing feature for Premium/Elite users. All 15 backend API tests passed (100%). Frontend UI testing confirmed: Premium/Elite plans show 'Fast ARRIS Processing' feature with ⚡ icon, Pro/Free/Starter plans correctly do NOT show this feature. ARRIS insights now include processing_time_seconds and priority_processed fields. Fixed a bug where these fields were being filtered out in the feature_gating.py filter_arris_insights function.",
